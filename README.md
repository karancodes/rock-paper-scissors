# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple C++ Rock-Paper-Scissors program based on the original game (with a little twist) I created as a part of CMPT 135 @SFU, to practice OOP concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

## Game Description
Each weapon (rock, paper or scissor) is assigned a numerical strength by the user in the beginning. When facing each other:
  1. Rock's strength is doubled when playing against scissors but halved against paper.
  2. Paper's strength is doubled when playing against rock but halved against scissors.
  3. Scissors' strength is doubled when playing against paper but halved against rock.
